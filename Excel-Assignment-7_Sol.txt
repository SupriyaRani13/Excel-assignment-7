a)Fit Content: When you have cell contents that are too long or wide for the default column or row width, using AutoFit ensures that the content 
  is fully visible without being truncated. 

b)Enhanced Readability: By using AutoFit, you can optimize the layout of your spreadsheet for better readability. 


4.How can you insert new rows and columns into the existing table?

2.Right-click on the selected row and choose the "Insert" or Insert Row option from the context menu. Alternatively, we can also go 
  to the "Insert" tab in the toolbar and click on the Insert Sheet Rows button.
3.A new row will be inserted above the selected row, pushing the existing rows downward.we can start entering data or formulas in the newly inserted row.

Inserting a New Column:-

1.Select the column to the right of which you want to insert the new column. Click on the column letter at the top to select the entire column.
2.Right-click on the selected column and choose the Insert or Insert Column option from the context menu. Alternatively, we can go to the

Sol:Hiding Columns:-

1.Select the column(s) that you want to hide. You can do this by clicking on the column header(s) at the top of the spreadsheet. To select 
  multiple columns, hold down the Ctrl key while clicking on the desired column headers.

   visible on the spreadsheet.

Unhiding Columns:

1.Select the columns adjacent to the hidden columns. For example, if we have hidden columns C and D, select columns B and E.
2.Right-click on any selected column header, and from the context menu, choose Unhide or Unhide Columns. Alternatively, go to
 the Home tab in the toolbar, click on the "Format" dropdown in the "Cells" group, choose "Hide & Unhide" and then Unhide Columns.

6.Create an appropriate table within the worksheet and use different functions available in the AutoSum command.

Sol: An example of an appropriate table within a worksheet where we can use different functions available in the AutoSum command:-

  A	B	C	   D
Item	Price	Quantity   Total
Apple	1.5	10	   =B2*C2
Banana	0.8	15	   =B3*C3
Orange	2.0	8	   =B4*C4
Total			   =SUM(D2:D4)


 In this example, we have a table with four columns: "Item," "Price," "Quantity," and "Total." The "Total" column uses the AutoSum command to 
 calculate the product of the Price and Quantity for each item.

To use different functions available in the AutoSum command:-

1.Select cell D2, which is the first cell in the "Total" column.
2.Click on the AutoSum button (âˆ‘) in the toolbar or go to the "Formulas" tab and click on the "AutoSum" dropdown in the "Editing" group.
3.By default, AutoSum selects the adjacent cells above the active cell (in this case, cells D2 and D3).
4.Press Enter to apply the SUM function, which sums the values in cells D2 and D3.
5.Cell D4 will display the total value calculated by the SUM function.
6.we can also use different AutoSum functions by clicking on the drop-down arrow next to the AutoSum button in the toolbar.
7.Some commonly used functions available in AutoSum include AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN, and more.
